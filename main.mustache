# Hi! Welcome to my GitHub Profile

### Software engineer at [iO](https://www.iodigital.com/nl)

I'm a **Frontend Developer**. I had the opportunity to work with different programming languages and frameworks in my junior days and that helped me to discover that what I enjoy the most is working as a JS developer, specially with ReactJS.

Working in startups and consultancies has given me the confidence to work with any kind of client, and I've had the opportunity to work on different projects but always with one thing in common, putting special emphasis on user experience and providing the best quality code.

Coding is my passion, I enjoy having the opportunity to create things from designs and client's ideas. I try to keep up to date with new technologies and feel challenged to keep myself in constant learning.

Learning from others and mentoring is also something I like, whenever I have the opportunity to help others I will be there. My goal is to have the opportunity to lead a team without leaving the code. 

In my free time I can be reading books and manga, watching anime, at the movies, at festivals or spending time with my friends. Meeting people and chatting recharges my energy but I also enjoy spending time with myself.

I'm still learning things but I hope to one day serve as an inspiration or reference for others.
